this is a report of the progress done until checkpoint1 of the SOC : CNN and its Apllications 2021

things learned till now:
   different library knowledge in python programming like numpy, matplotlib, csv, scikit-learn, PIL, CV2 etc
   machine learning course from basics to linear regression, gradient descent, logistic regresssion, Regularisation, CNN until week 5 of the coursera course by prof. Andrews N.G.

things done in project till now:
   the core project hasn't started yet but we have done 3 assignments till now and 4th on the line to be done before 13th april
   the Assignment-1 deals with learning Github Git and python usages of numpy to analyse and edit crop images using PIL and CV2
   the Assignment-2 deals with Linear regression , finding cost function and optimum theta value and plotting of data using matplotlib along with best fit line tracing
   the Assignment-3 deals with Logistic regression , finding its sigmoid hypothesis and cost function, working on Data of pixels of an image
   the Assignment-4 to be done is based on CNN and its basics
   
meets and doubts:
   there has been two meets along with a regular active discord conversation and support from the mentors and among we mentees too
